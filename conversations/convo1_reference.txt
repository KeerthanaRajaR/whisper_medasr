Doctor: Good morning, this is Dr. Ananya, dentist at SmileCare Clinic. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Good morning doctor. I’m a bit nervous. I’ve been having pain on the left lower jaw for almost two weeks now.

Doctor: That’s okay, we’ll go step by step. Is the pain sharp or dull?

Patient: It’s a dull pain most of the time, but when I drink cold water it becomes very sharp.

Doctor: Understood. Any swelling or fever?

Patient: No fever, but slight swelling near the left molar area.

Doctor: I’m going to examine your oral cavity now. Please open your mouth slowly.

Patient: Okay doctor.

Doctor: I see a deep cavity in the lower left first molar. The tooth appears sensitive to percussion. This could indicate pulpitis.

Patient: Is that serious?

Doctor: It can be if untreated. We may need to do a root canal treatment. Before that, I’ll take an X-ray.

Patient: Will it hurt?

Doctor: You may feel mild discomfort, but no pain. We’ll use local anesthesia, lidocaine 2 percent.

Patient: I’m allergic to penicillin. Is that okay?

Doctor: Yes, that’s important information. I’ll avoid prescribing amoxicillin. If needed, we can use clindamycin 300 milligrams, three times a day.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: The X-ray shows infection near the root apex. We’ll schedule the root canal on the right side of your mouth next visit.

Patient: I thought it was the left?

Doctor: Sorry, correction — left lower molar. Thank you for catching that.

Patient: How long will the procedure take?

Doctor: About 60 to 90 minutes. After the procedure, avoid chewing on the left side for at least 24 hours.

Patient: Will I need painkillers?

Doctor: You can take ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours if needed. Do not exceed 1200 mg per day.

Patient: Alright.

Doctor: Also, there are no signs of gum infection or abscess. No signs of systemic infection.

Patient: That’s a relief.

Doctor: I’ll see you next week. If pain worsens, contact us immediately.
